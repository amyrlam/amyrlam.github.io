  <p>ðŸ‘‹ it's me on the interweb</p>
  
  <p>Amy is a product-minded developer with a focus on the frontend. She is a Senior Software Engineer with eight years of experience, currently studying at <a href='https://formation.dev/' target='_blank'>Formation</a>. Throughout her career, Amy has been drawn toward problem solving around User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). As an engineer, she is especially interested in design systems, frontend infrastructure, civic tech, accessibility, and data visualization.</p>
  
  <p>Amy has previously worked on frontend engineering teams at VoteAmerica, U.S. Digital Response, BetterUp, Fastly, and Lemnos Labs. At VoteAmerica, she led engineering on our flagship polling place locator tool, which helped support record-breaking voter turnout efforts during the November 2020 election. VoteAmerica did over 9.5M polling place lookups in 2020. Voters performed 465,000 lookups on the VoteAmerica website, and the free web tool was embedded on over 100 different websites.</p>
  
  <p>Before moving to Silicon Valley, Amy had a previous career as a Mechanical Engineer at Boeing, earning her masterâ€™s degree from USC and her bachelorâ€™s degree from MIT. A graduate class in Human-Computer Interaction inspired her to change careers and transition from hardware to software.</p>

  <p>Amy does open source programming as part of the <a href='https://emberjs.com/teams/' target='_blank'>Ember.js Core Learning Team</a> and is a Mentor Coach for <a href='http://www.code2040.org/' target='_blank'>Code2040</a>. When sheâ€™s not making the web a better place, Amy enjoys playing dodgeball (when allowed again!), strolling her senior dog around San Francisco, and growing her houseplant collection.</p>
