  <p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Fastly, working on bringing an intuitive user experience to the complicated world of caching. Fastly now serves over 10% of all requests on the interweb!</p>

  <p>Lately, I've been writing for <a href="https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/">The Ember.js Times</a>. We blog about what's new and happening in Ember this week in an approachable way. I participated in the <a href="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/fbmentorship/docs/en/program-overview.html">Facebook Open Source mentorship program</a>, working on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus">Docusaurus</a>. Docusaurus is a static site generator that makes it easy to maintain open source documentation websites. Prettier, React Native, and ReasonML are some well-known users of Docusaurus.</p>

  <p>I previously worked on product design for early-stage startups, with a focus on user experience design and research for web and mobile. Before that, I was a mechanical engineer at Boeing, building satellite hardware. ðŸ›°</p>

  <p>I love living in the vibrant Mission district of San Francisco. Previously, I lived in Los Angeles, Boston, and Connecticut. I am a dogemom to a one-eyed Lakeland Terrier, Tessy (full name Tesla). Right now my favorite article headline is "Millennials are filling their homes â€” and the void in their hearts â€” with houseplants". I'm a fan of #doingthings and especially enjoy dodgeball, yoga, Classpass-ing, and skiing.</p>
